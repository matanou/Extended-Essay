# Extended-Essay
Adressing the question of "How can the Mandelbrot set relate to chaos in population growth?"

Preface.	

This extended essay explores the connection between fractal geometry and chaos theory through a study of the Mandelbrot set and its applications to modelling population dynamics. The project combines theoretical mathematics with computational simulations written in Python, it aims to unpack how simple iterative rules can lead to unexpectedly complex behaviour.
This essay assumes familiarity with some foundational mathematical concepts. Readers are expected to have a basic understanding of:
Complex numbers, including arithmetic operations and the representation of complex numbers in the form a + ib where i² = -1


- Cartesian and complex planes, as used in visualizing fractals.

- Exponents and sequences, particularly iterative functions.

- Mathematical logic and notation, including symbols such as ∀ (for all), ∃ (there exists), and ⇒ (implies). (See Math Vault, 2020. “Logic symbols”)


Where necessary, brief explanations are provided, but the focus remains on applying these concepts rather than teaching them in depth. The more advanced computational elements of the essay are also explained conceptually to remain accessible to readers with minimal programming experience.
All code and original illustrations used in this essay are available via the GitHub repository referenced in the bibliography. Similarly any illustration used, if not referenced explicitly as from another author, will be present on my GitHub referenced in the bibliography.
